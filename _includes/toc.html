	<strong>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Participation in the Developers Program. </strong>The Developers Program is a set of APIs and tools that allow the Developers to create Applications to access and interact with the Site, certain MERCADOLIBRE Contents, and the MERCADOLIBRE services. Participation in the Developers Program gives the Developers access to MERCADOLIBRE’s Developers Program Tools. These tools allow the Developers to access the Site, MERCADOLIBRE’s services and certain MERCADOLIBRE Content to develop Applications that integrate with or facilitate the use of the Site and MERCADOLIBRE’s services.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 54pt;">
	<strong>2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Use of MERCADOLIBRE’s Developers Program Tools.</strong> The Developers’ use of MERCADOLIBRE’s Developers Program Tools is only permitted for facilitating, improving, and/or enhancing the Application Users’ use and operation of the Site and MERCADOLIBRE’s services.</p>

	<strong>2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Using the API. As part of their participation in the Developers Program and subject to this Agreement, MERCADOLIBRE grants &nbsp;the Developers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable (except as expressly permitted herein) license to use the API solely to do the following and subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement: </strong></p>

	<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>MERCADOLIBRE CONTENT</strong></p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Developers may not withhold the MERCADOLIBRE User’s identity tokens.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 54pt;">
	<strong>3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Public Display.</strong>The Developers may display MERCADOLIBRE Content that any MERCADOLIBRE User makes publicly available on the MERCADOLIBRE Site, during the time that such MERCADOLIBRE Content is publicly available, to promote MERCADOLIBRE and enable the Application’s Users to search and browse listings (<strong>“Public Display”</strong>).

This period shall be of 6 (six) hours for MERCADOLIBRE Content consisting in item and/or service listing information posted on the Site. The Application must disclose how often it updates the MERCADOLIBRE Content and, in particular, the item and service listings vis-à-vis the information posted by MERCADOLIBRE.</p>

	<strong>Exhibit A</strong></p>
<p align="center">
	<strong><u>API Security Standards</u></strong></p>
<p align="center">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Developers will comply with the following API Security Standards (“Security Standards”):</p>
<ol><li>
		<u>Security Audits</u></li>
</ol><p style="margin-left: 37.5pt;">
	<strong>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Audit. </strong>MERCADOLIBRE reserves the right to periodically audit the Systems to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Exhibit. Non-intrusive network and application security scans may be performed randomly without prior notice.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.5pt;">
	<strong>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Audit After a Security Breach Incident. For purposes of these Security Standards, a “Security Breach” is defined as a breach of security of the Developers’ facility, systems or site where MERCADOLIBRE Content or MERCADOLIBRE User Data has been acquired by an unauthorized person. In the event of a Security Breach, MERCADOLIBRE may suspend or terminate the Developers’ access to the API and MERCADOLIBRE Content and MERCADOLIBRE may conduct a security audit.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.5pt;">
	<strong>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>MERCADOLIBRE’s Results and the Developers’ Response. </strong>MERCADOLIBRE will provide the Developers with detailed results of any security audit performed by MERCADOLIBRE pursuant to these Security Standards. The Developers will be granted thirty (30) days to resolve any issues MERCADOLIBRE has identified through a security audit. Should the Developers fail to resolve such identified issues, MERCADOLIBRE may immediately suspend or terminate the Developers’ access to the API and MERCADOLIBRE Content without notice.</p>
<ol><li>
		<u>Security Precautions: Best Practices.</u>The Developers agree to adhere at all times to reasonable security practices, as specified in current industry literature on topics relevant to the Developers’ interaction with MERCADOLIBRE. In the event such best practices conflict with these Security Standards, the Developers will comply with these Security Standards.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><u>Data Security</u></strong><strong>: Data Storage. The Developers agree to maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security of the following information, whether provided by a MERCADOLIBRE User to the Providers or obtained from MERCADOLIBRE through the API:</strong></li>
</ol><p style="margin-left: 53.25pt;">
	a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCADOLIBRE User e-mail addresses </p>
<p style="margin-left: 53.25pt;">
	b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authentication tokens</p>

	c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCADOLIBRE User ID (includes API Developer ID, Application ID, and Certificate ID)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 53.25pt;">

<p>
	At no time will the Developers collect or store MERCADOLIBRE User passwords, credit card numbers, financial information, Social Security Numbers, Driver's License numbers, or State Identification Card numbers, in any form. MERCADOLIBRE User IDs used to authenticate access to the API must be kept secret and confidential and under no circumstances be exposed to the public. If MERCADOLIBRE believes that MERCADOLIBRE User IDs have been compromised, MERCADOLIBRE reserves the right to immediately terminate access and issue a new MERCADOLIBRE User ID to the Developers.</p>
