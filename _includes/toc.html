Participation in the Developers Program gives the Developers access to MERCADOLIBRE’s Developers Program Tools. These tools allow the Developers to access the Site, MERCADOLIBRE’s services and certain MERCADOLIBRE Content to develop Applications that integrate with or facilitate the use of the Site and MERCADOLIBRE’s services.
</p>

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>

</p>

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>

The Access Keys are the property of MERCADOLIBRE and, together with the participation in the Developers Program, they may be revoked if the Developers share them with any third party (other than as allowed under this Agreement) and/or compromise them and/or breach any term of this Agreement and/or if MERCADOLIBRE unilaterally terminates this Agreement.
</p>

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>
	<strong>2.2.3 API Call Limitations. The number of API calls the Developer will be permitted to make during any given period may be limited by MERCADOLIBRE in its discretion. MERCADOLIBRE will determine call limits based on various factors, including the ways the Application may be used by its Developer or the anticipated volume of use associated with the Application. The number of permitted API calls for each Developer will be specified on a case-by-case basis by means of an HTTP header.

The Developers will be responsible for all costs associated with certification and any modifications necessary to meet the certification criteria and the Developers may not be permitted by MERCADOLIBRE to access the public database in certain cases until certification is complete. Future modifications of the Application and/or the conditions of use or display of the MERCADOLIBRE Content may be subject to re-certification. If MERCADOLIBRE requires certification, failure by the Developers to maintain certification is cause for immediate termination of this Agreement.

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>
	<strong>3.1.1 Authentication.</strong> If the Application will enable its Users to interact with the Site in a way that requires sign-in to their MERCADOLIBRE accounts (for example, bidding, buying, listing or access to Mi MercadoLibre), the Developer may provide this access only after <strong>"Authentication"</strong>, which occurs when a MERCADOLIBRE User grants the Application access to that User’s MERCADOLIBRE Content via a sign-in and express consent page. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Developers may not withhold the MERCADOLIBRE User’s identity tokens. 
</p>

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>
	<strong>3.1.2 Public Display.</strong> The Developers may display MERCADOLIBRE Content that any MERCADOLIBRE User makes publicly available on the MERCADOLIBRE Site, during the time that such MERCADOLIBRE Content is publicly available, to promote MERCADOLIBRE and enable the Application’s Users to search and browse listings (<strong>“Public Display”</strong>). When the MERCADOLIBRE Content is no longer publicly available, the Developers must delete it from the Application.
</p>

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>
	3.1.2.1 MERCADOLIBRE Content in a Public Display may not be co-mingled or combined with the content of any third party. All MERCADOLIBRE Content must be segregated and visually separated from non-MERCADOLIBRE Content (for example, with lines or color changes).

<p align="justify" style='margin-left: 53.25pt;'>

	<strong>3.1.3 Age of Listings.</strong> The Developers shall update at least every 24 (twenty-four) hours the MERCADOLIBRE Content included in the Applications. Therefore, no Application may publish MERCADOLIBRE Content deleted from the Site 24 (twenty-four) hours before they were displayed in the Application. This period shall be of 6 (six) hours for MERCADOLIBRE Content consisting in item and/or service listing information posted on the Site. The Application must disclose how often it updates the MERCADOLIBRE Content and, in particular, the item and service listings vis-à-vis the information posted by MERCADOLIBRE.
