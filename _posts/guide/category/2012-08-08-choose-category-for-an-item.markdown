## How to choose a category to list an item

There isn't a explicit way or tool to define an item category for your product. We will see diferent ways to discover what's the best category for an item.

## Search similar items in MercadoLibre's site

The simplest process could be to use the [Category API](/category-introduction) and navigate the category's tree to detect the best option. You must use only those categories retrieved from the API which don't have sub-categories related.

## Indentify similar items

Another option could be to find similar items in MercadoLibre and use their category.
