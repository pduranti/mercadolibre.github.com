When you first register on MercadoLibre, you are immediately able to buy items. But if you want to sell items, some extra information may be needed depending on your country. If you try to list an item via the API without completing this information, you will receive an error. To avoid this and the trouble of looking up the meaning of the error, we recommend starting a selling flow through the site up to the step where the extra information is required.


- **1. Login/Register:** Start by registering/logging in


- **2. Start list flow:** Click on the sell button on the home page

- **3. Complete the form:** The first time you start selling you should get a form like the one below. Fill in and confirm the form; now you are ready to list items through the site or the APIs.<br>
