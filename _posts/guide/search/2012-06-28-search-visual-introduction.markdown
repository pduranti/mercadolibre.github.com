Searching items is the most common thing to do in MercadoLibre. Here you can see different search criteria.
The API provides programmatic access to the search.

There are a number of tools to complete and refine your search. You can add words in the search text field to refine your [search by text query] (/search-by-text-query) (1). Also, you can [search by categories](/search-by-category) (2) following the category path. In order to refine results you can [search using filters](/search-filtering) (3). To retrieve data you can [search by paging](/search-paging) (4). To search in a given order, you can [sort your results](/search-using-sorting) (5)
