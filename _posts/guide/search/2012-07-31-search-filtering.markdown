## Overview {#search-overview}

The search operation retrieves a list of items. You can refine your search by using search filters. Search filters allow you to narrow down the results to those that match certain criteria. Typically, you will use these filters when you are interested in refining a previous search result. 

There are different kinds of filters and each item has different ones.  

<div class="contents">
  <h5>Table of Contents</h5>
  <dl>
    <dt><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="goToByScroll('search-request')">Request</a></dt>
    <dt><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="goToByScroll('search-response')">Response</a></dt>
  </dl>
</div>

## Request {#search-request}

When you call a search operation, it returns metadata information that can be used to perform subsequent searches and refine search results.  

<pre class="terminal">In order to refine the search
curl https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search?q=ipod
</pre>

You will obtain a list of special filters which can be applied to reduce results.

{% highlight javascript %}

"available_filters": - [
    {...},
    {
      "id": "price",
      "name": "Rango de precios",
      "type": "range",
      "values": [
        {
          "id": "*-750.0",
          "name": "Hasta $750",
          "results": 385,
        },
        {
          "id": "750.0-1000.0",
          "name": "$750 a $1.000",
          "results": 265,
        },
        {
          "id": "1000.0-*",
          "name": "MÃ¡s de $1.000",
          "results": 512,
        },
      ],
    },
    {...},
    {...},
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

In order to refine the search, you can add those filters that you need following this pattern: <code>&amp;FilterID=FilterValue</code>. An example of this could be this filtering:

<pre class="terminal">
curl https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search?q=ipod&amp;price=700.0-1000.0
</pre>

## Response {#search-response}

The Search response has a lot of parameters. Use <code>OPTIONS</code> http method to get a <code>JSON</code> encoded response that will describe the API, with all the allowed methods and connections to another part of the API. It is a standard format to get [API documentation](/design-considerations/#options).
