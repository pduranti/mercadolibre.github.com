The PHP SDK enables you to access the API from a web application developed in [PHP](http://www.php.net).
It  hides all the complexity of OAuth 2.0 and lets you focus on writing application code.

You'll find the source code in the following location: [https://github.com/mercadolibre/php-sdk](https://github.com/mercadolibre/php-sdk)

Initialize the SDK with your __client_id__ as follows:

{% highlight php %}
// Try to put this code at the top
require '../src/meli.php';

// Create our Application instance (replace this with your appId and secret).
$meli = new Meli(array(
    'appId'         => 12345,
    'secret'        => dsadsaDWFfs24DF34dgg43T3,
));
{% endhighlight %}
	

You can use __getWithAccessToken__ to make requests to the API adding an __access_token__. Or just use __get__ method to make anonymous calls.
