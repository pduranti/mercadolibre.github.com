The JAVA SDK enables you to access the API from a web application developed in [JAVA](http://www.java.com).
It hides all the complexity of OAuth 2.0 and lets you focus on writing application code.

You'll find the source code in the following location: [https://github.com/mercadolibre/java-sdk](https://github.com/mercadolibre/java-sdk)

With the source code you'll find documentation on how to use the SDK.
