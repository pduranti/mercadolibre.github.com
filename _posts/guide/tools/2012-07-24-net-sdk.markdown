The .NET SDK enables you to access the API from a web application developed in [Microsoft .NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net) and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com).
It hides all the complexity of OAuth 2.0 and lets you focus on writing application code.

You'll find the source code in the following location: [https://github.com/mercadolibre/net-sdk](https://github.com/mercadolibre/net-sdk)

With the source code you'll find documentation on how to use the SDK.
