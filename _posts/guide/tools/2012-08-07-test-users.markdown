## Overview {#overview}

You can create test users to support you in the process of developing with our API. Test users can operate as normal users: listing, buying and asking questions.
Test users donâ€™t pay any charges.

Test users will eventually be washed out and you can create new ones.

For the moment each user can create up to 10 test users.

## How to create a test user 

You need to have your application and a valid user to obtain an access_token.
 If you haven't got your access_token yet, start here: [Authentication &amp; Authorization guide](/authentication-and-authorization).

site_id is the input parameter. It is the site where the user is allowed to operate e.g.: MLA, MLB, MLM.

For a complete list of sites see [Site API](https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites).

### POST to create the user
Each API call creates 1 test user.


<pre class="terminal">

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
'{
 	"site_id":"MLA"
}'
https://api.mercadolibre.com/users/test_user?access_token=...

</pre>

### Response {#response}
Id, nickname and password are returned in the response.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
	"id":120506781,
	"nickname":"TEST0548",
	"password":"qatest328",
	"site_status":"active"
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Considerations when using Test Users {#policies}

When working with test users, you need to take into account the following considerations.

<ul class="ch-list parameters">
	<li>When you publish an item, the title must say it is a testing item.</li>
	<li>List under the "Others" category as much as possible. </li>
	<li>Do not publish items with listing types "gold" or "gold_premium" that can appear in the home page.</li>
	<li>Test users can only operate with test items. Test users can only buy and make questions on test items.</li>
	<li>Test users showing no activity (buy, ask, publish, etc.) during 60 days are removed.</li>
	<li>Test items are removed regularly.</li>
</ul>
