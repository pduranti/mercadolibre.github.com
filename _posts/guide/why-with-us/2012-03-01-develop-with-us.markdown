## About Us

We are the biggest e-commerce platform in Latin America, connecting people from over 13 countries.

Our ecosystem:

<ul class="ch-list parameters">
<li><strong>Marketplace</strong> is our core product, where people can buy and sell at a fixed price or list almost any product, vehicle, real estate or service.</li>
<li><strong>MercadoPago</strong> is a service that lets you send and receive money online for purchases on MercadoLibre or in any
other commerce that integrates with the platform. If you're a collector or want to develop a payments related
app, head over to <a href="https://developers.mercadopago.com/" target="_blank">MercadoPago Developers.</a></li>
<li><strong>MercadoShops</strong> is a platform that helps you build and administrate your own online store.</li>
<li><strong>MercadoClics</strong> is our advertising product, offering pay-per-click text ads that appear on the site's
